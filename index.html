<h1>Optional/Personal Info</h1>

<p>Growing up on a farm, I learned the value of utility. If something wasn&#39;t useful, it was thrown out to make room for something that we needed more. This has greatly influenced my design style. I try and make sure that each element of a design has a specific thought process and purpose behind it. If it doesn&#39;t help to communicate the message I&#39;m trying to send, I delete it. I would describe my personal style as minimalist, illustrative and grid-based. I am deadline oriented and excel at presenting my work.</p>

<h1>Major</h1>

<p><strong>Visual Communication Design</strong></p>

<p>I am currently beginning my last year at Eastern Washington University in pursuit of a degree in Visual Communication Design (VCD). I&#39;ve always had a passion for organization. It sounds strange, I know, but even as a little kid I was rearranging my toys and bookshelves. This is what drew me to my current major. I&#39;ve never considered myself much of an artist, but I really enjoy organizing visual content. In the book <em>How to Think Like a Graphic Designer</em> by Debbie Millman, Paula Scher defines graphic design as, &quot;the art of planning.&quot; This is how I view my major and my chosen career field. </p>

<p><strong>Professional Objectives</strong></p>

<p>I hope to work creating visual representations of data, creating brands, or utilizing my growing interest in web design. I want to grow as a designer, both individually and in successfully fulfilling my roles in group situations. I want to continue to refine and streamline my design process. Most of all, I want to create work that both I and my future clients can be proud of.</p>
